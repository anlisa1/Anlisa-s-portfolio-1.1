                                <p>“Compared to students who did not expect to have any student loan debt at graduation, students who expected to have below average debt (OR = 1.686), average debt (OR = 2.023), and above average debt (OR=3.024) were significantly more likely to report financial stress”( page 30).</p>

                                <p>This generally says that those who have expected graduation debt were more financially 
                                    stressed than those who didn’t have expected graduation debt. 
                                    People who have expected graduation debt feel unclear about their financial future 
                                    because they are expected to eventually pay it off and there are also interest rates 
                                    on top of it. Not knowing when you can pay it off, or even if you can free yourself of 
                                    debt at all in this lifetime, distracts people from their studies and further drags them down as 
                                    their grades drop, and it can potentially turn into a cycle of stress.

                                    Now that we know that what is expected of them adds 
                                    pressure because they do not know if they can do it. A solution that 
                                    this will tilt towards is probably strengthening their goal of why 
                                    they decided to go to college to begin with. As long as their goals 
                                    are strengthened and perhaps connect to facets of their career choices
                                    to lighten some career burdens, the debt won't disappear but may 
                                    become a driving force for the students to work harder.

                                <p>”Perceived stress is defined as the extent to which an individual 
                                    perceives that their demands exceed their ability to cope, and 
                                    is a major factor in academic disruption and poor academic performance”</p>

                                    This says that financial strains are less of an issue than perceived 
                                    stress as it is not tackled on much. The article also mentioned not 
                                    in here but that ⅘ top stressors were related to personal finance.
                                    Which means to say that perceived stress, and their perceived ability 
                                    to cope with financial demands is the cause of financial stress. 
                                    Whether it is the future or present their perception of their own ability 
                                    to pay back debt or support themselves in the future causes stress.

                                    What this redirects me to is the importance of perceived stress.
                                    How you perceive yourself and how you perceive going to college and 
                                    debt. Perhaps a method to empower college students and to boost their 
                                    self confidence 
                                    that they do have the ability to make money and pay off their debt.

                        Your current financial situation may also cause stress about

                        have the means or money to support yourself.
                        Also too much stress on money may cloud your mind, 
                        an make you unable to focus on your studies.

                                <p>A basic need is good air quality, but without good air quality you
                                    have more people stressed they said, in the times of the pandemic. 
                                    The students did not have the means of supporting themselves with good

                                    because they had to deal with financial issues. This associates the

                                    The implications are that we should also maybe focus on the

                                    The article said that college students in poverty juggle between jobs and classwork, and gain health issues when they lack sleep from juggling multiple tasks.

                                    This connects to how current living standards caused by financial stress,
                                    causes even more stress and lower academic performances. Since there 
                                    financial situation right now is not the best they have to make a way to 
                                    earn money to support themselves, which adds more stress if the person gets 
                                    barely any time to relax.
